# liborthros
liborthros is a simple objc library used to communicate to an Orthros API server. Using this you can query all of the API functions implemented on the server-side. This library will not perform the RSA encryption or key generation required to properly encrypt messages or authenticate users, that is up to you to implement and handle (this may change in the soon future)
